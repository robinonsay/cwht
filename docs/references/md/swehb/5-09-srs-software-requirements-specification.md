# 1. Minimum Recommended Content

Minimum recommended content for the Software Requirements Specification. The following section outlines the minimum content for the Software Requirements Specification (SRS), consistent with the latest recommendations and best practices. The SRS provides a clear, detailed, and comprehensive definition of software requirements for a project, a Computer Software Configuration Item (CSCI), or a group of CSCIs. It serves as the foundation for design, implementation, verification, validation, and maintenance. This document reflects the results of decomposing user-defined requirements into detailed, actionable software requirements at a level sufficient for development and testing.

An SRS may be structured into multiple volumes or sections, as appropriate, as long as the documentation collectively addresses the information specified below.

a.   **Introduction** – The introduction sets the context for the SRS and provides essential background information. It establishes the purpose and scope of the software requirements and introduces the software system being described.

1. **Purpose** – Define the purpose of the SRS and its intended audience. Explain how the document supports the project lifecycle and stakeholders.
2. **Scope** – Describe the product or software system under development, including its key objectives, benefits, and intended users. Discuss the problem domain and how the software addresses specific user needs.
3. **System Software Overview** – Provide an overview of the software system and its major components, including a high-level description of its functionality, context, and relationships with other systems or environments.

b.    **Computer Software Configuration Item (CSCI) requirements** – The CSCI requirements section is the core of the SRS, encompassing both functional and non-functional requirements for the software product. Each requirement should be specific, testable, and traceable. Provide requirements for each of the following requirement types:

1. **Functional Requirements** – Define the software's behavior and operations in detail, including any specific conditions or constraints. This includes, but is not limited to:
   1. **General Functional Requirements**.

   10. **Operating System Requirements**.
   11. **Board Support Package Requirements**.
   12. **Partitioning Requirements**.
   13. **Fault Tolerance and Common Mode Requirements**.
2. **Non-Functional Requirements** – Describe the software characteristics that impact how the software operates and behaves. Include:
   1. **Performance and Timing Requirements** – Include latency, throughput, response time, and other performance constraints.
   2. **Software Quality Attributes** – Specify quality characteristics for the -ilities (i.e., reliability, maintainability, availability, scalability, etc.).
   3. **Design and Implementation Constraints** – Highlight any constraints and limitations imposed by the system, hardware, standards, compliance, regulations, or tools.
   4. **Computer Hardware Resource Utilization** – Define memory, processor, storage, and other resource requirements.
3. **Interface Requirements** – Detail the necessary interactions the software will have with systems, users, and devices for the following types of interfaces:
   1. **External Software Interfaces** – Describe how the software system interacts with external entities.
   2. **Internal Software Interfaces** – Identify interfaces between software components.
   3. **User Interfaces** – Specify how end-users will interact with the software, including accessibility considerations.
   4. **System Interfaces** – Detail interdependencies with system features or configurations.
   5. **Hardware Interfaces** – Describe how the software system interacts with the hardware components.
   6. **Communication Interfaces** – Specify protocols, data formats, and network requirements.
   7. **Services Interfaces** – Include requirements for connections to web services, APIs, or cloud platforms.
4. **User Requirements** – Define user-specific needs, focusing on usability, personalization, and human-machine interaction.

d.    **Rationale and Supporting Information** – Provide the rationale, context, and justification for requirements.  
e.   **Additional Requirements and Information** – Include any other information necessary to describe the software requirements in full.

Software requirements specifications need not be textual and may include representations in rigorous specification languages, graphical representations, or specifications suitable for requirements analysis tools or methodologies.

# 2. Rationale

A Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a cornerstone document in the software development lifecycle, detailing software performance, interface, operational, and quality requirements for each Computer Software Configuration Item (CSCI). It defines in precise terms the software product to be delivered by a provider to a customer and serves as a contractual and instructional foundation upon which all project stages are built. The SRS is vital not only as a reference document but also as a communication bridge among all stakeholders, ensuring clarity, alignment, and accountability throughout the lifecycle of the project.

The SRS is especially critical because all subsequent project deliverables—such as software architecture, design, implementation, testing, validation, and user documentation—are founded on the requirements outlined in this document. Additional supporting references, like data dictionaries or interface requirements specifications, contribute to the detail and precision captured in the SRS.

The importance of documenting the system and software requirements is reflected in standards such as IEEE 29148, which emphasizes the following benefits:  [696](#_tabs-<p></p>)

* it establishes the basis for agreement between the acquirers or suppliers on what the product is to do (in market driven projects, the user input may be provided by marketing.
* it forces a rigorous assessment of requirements before design can begin and reduces later redesign.
* it provides a realistic basis for estimating product costs, risks and schedules.
* organizations can use the specifications to develop validation and verification plans.
* it provides an informed basis for deploying a product to new users or new operational environments.
* it provides a basis for product enhancement.

## 2.1    Rationale Behind Writing an SRS

The rationale behind developing an SRS can be further elaborated in terms of its high-impact benefits across multiple dimensions of software development:

1. **Clarity and Agreement**  
   An SRS ensures that all stakeholders—ranging from developers and testers to customers, end-users, and project managers—have a clear, consistent, and shared understanding of the system’s requirements. This is critical to avoiding misinterpretations or misalignments during development. By explicitly documenting requirements, it creates a single source of truth that bridges the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders.
2. **Foundation for Design and Development**  
   The SRS serves as a blueprint for the system’s architecture, guiding key design decisions, implementation strategies, and the development of subsystem components. By decomposing high-level user needs into actionable and measurable software requirements, the SRS connects user expectations with technical design solutions. This ensures that the end product fulfills its intended purpose.
3. **Basis for Validation, Verification, and Testing**  
   A properly documented SRS provides a definitive set of measurable criteria for evaluation. It enables validation (ensuring the system meets user needs) and verification (ensuring the product satisfies its specifications). Well-defined requirements make it easier to perform robust testing and confirm that the software meets all expectations before deployment.
4. **Scope Management**  
   The SRS clearly defines what features, functionality, and constraints are in scope and explicitly states what is out of scope for the project. By doing so, it helps manage scope creep—unsanctioned changes to the project that can lead to extended timelines, unforeseen costs, and resource misallocation—ensuring that the project stays aligned with agreed objectives.
5. **Realistic Project Planning and Execution**  
   The SRS provides a solid basis for project planning regarding resources, cost, and scheduling. Clear and detailed requirements allow project teams to more accurately allocate resources, estimate effort for different components, and identify critical path activities. This leads to better management of budgets and timelines.
6. **Improved Communication**  
   The SRS acts as a communication bridge, especially between technical stakeholders (e.g., developers, testers, architects) and non-technical stakeholders (e.g., customers, end-users, business analysts). By documenting every requirement with precision and clarity, the SRS minimizes ambiguities and assumptions, fostering collaborative discussions about project goals, trade-offs, and priorities.
7. **Risk Identification and Reduction**  
   An SRS helps identify potential technical, operational, and business risks early in the development lifecycle by exposing incomplete, infeasible, or conflicting requirements. Uncovering these risks before system design and development begins reduces the likelihood of introducing costly changes at later stages. The early identification of dependencies, constraints, and performance bottlenecks improves overall risk management.
8. **Basis for Product Evolution and Maintenance**  
   As users interact with the software and new requirements emerge, the SRS serves as a historical reference point for understanding how current features align with previously documented requirements. This informed basis enables smoother product updates, future enhancements, and scaling to new users or environments.
9. **Compliance with Standards and Regulations**  
   For projects in regulated industries (e.g., healthcare, aerospace), the SRS is instrumental in demonstrating compliance with applicable legal, regulatory, and safety standards. It ensures that requirements related to privacy, security, and functionality are explicitly defined and adequately addressed during development.
10. **Long-Term Knowledge Retention**  
    The SRS acts as a living document that retains organizational knowledge about the software product and its requirements. This is particularly valuable for long-term maintenance, support, and onboarding of new team members, ensuring continuity even as personnel or business needs change.

By documenting software requirements comprehensively, an SRS ultimately acts as both a technical guide and a strategic asset, aligning stakeholders, optimizing development efforts, minimizing risks, and ensuring the delivery of high-quality software that meets user needs effectively.

# 3. Guidance

Writing a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a fundamental step in the software development lifecycle. The SRS provides a clear, standardized, and structured definition of what the software must accomplish to meet user and system goals. It emphasizes functionality, behavior, and constraints while acting as a bridge between stakeholders, developers, and testers. An SRS also serves as the authoritative reference for all subsequent development and lifecycle processes, which underscores its criticality. The following guidance incorporates best practices, industry standards, and lessons learned to ensure clarity, completeness, adaptability, and traceability in software projects—particularly in complex, safety-critical environments.

When writing the SRS, it is important to capture specific, key information. Detailed guidance for capturing that information is provided in the sections below. Other sections, not listed below, that may be included in an SRS are:

* Audience, organization and contents of the SRS.
* Definitions, acronyms, abbreviations specific to the SRS.
* Summary of history of system development, operation, maintenance.
* Project sponsor, acquirer, user, developer, and support agencies.
* Current and planned operating sites.
* References.
* Appendices for supporting information like mockups, data models, or glossary.

Because requirements change and evolve over the life of the project, the SRS is typically revised as the project progresses. Guidance for managing these changes can be found in [SWE-053 - Manage Requirements Changes](/spaces/SWEHBVD/pages/102695435/SWE-053+-+Manage+Requirements+Changes) of this Handbook. Guidance for baselining and updating the SRS in preparation for life cycle milestone reviews can be found in Topic [7.08 - Maturity of Life Cycle Products at Milestone Reviews](/spaces/SWEHBVD/pages/102695638/7.08+-+Maturity+of+Life+Cycle+Products+at+Milestone+Reviews) in this Handbook. Data on requirements volatility is tracked in the Software Metrics Report (see [SWE-200 - Software Requirements Volatility Metrics](/spaces/SWEHBVD/pages/102695533/SWE-200+-+Software+Requirements+Volatility+Metrics) for additional information).

The following sections provide detailed guidance for implementing the Minimum Recommended Content of an SRS, highlighting examples, tips, and best practices for writing effective requirements.

## 3.1 Introduction

The introductory section provides the foundational context for the SRS and provides essential background information. Use it to establish the purpose and scope of the software requirements and introduce the software system being built.

### 3.1.1     Purpose

Specify the purpose of the SRS and how it contributes to the project’s lifecycle and stakeholders. Identify the document’s audience—such as developers, testers, system engineers, users, and acquirers.

Example: “The purpose of this SRS is to define the software requirements for the XYZ Mission Control Software. The SRS serves as a blueprint for all development stages and a contractual reference for alignment between stakeholders.”

### 3.1.2     Scope

Describe the software product under development, including the scope of its goals, functions, and limitations. Highlight its relationship with the larger system or mission objectives. Discuss the problem domain and how the software addresses specific user needs.

Example: "The software will allow ground controllers to monitor spacecraft telemetry in real-time and send corrective commands. The system will operate with a maximum latency of 5 seconds under nominal conditions but will not perform onboard diagnostics, as these are managed at the subsystem level."

### 3.1.3     Software System Overview

Provide an overview of the software system and its major components, including a high-level description of its functionality, context, and relationships with other systems or environments. The overview should allow the readers to quickly understand the software’s purpose and architecture before diving into the specific requirements. It should include:

* **CSCI Identifier**: CSCI name or other identifier (e.g., CSCI name and abbreviation/acronym)
* **Key Functions/Capabilities**: High-level summary of primary functions and components
  + **Product Perspective**: How the software fits into the larger system.
  + **Product Functions**: What the software will do.
* **Background Information**: Include supporting background information e.g.:
  + **Operating Environment**: Supported hardware, software, and networks.
  + **User Classes and Characteristics**: Define primary (e.g., mission operators) and secondary (e.g., maintenance personnel) user groups, highlighting their unique needs.
  + **Assumptions and Dependencies**: External factors, constraints, or limitations that influence requirements.
  + **Design and Implementation Constraints**: Any limitations (e.g., programming languages, frameworks)
* **Interfaces**: High-level summary of primary user interfaces, hardware interfaces, software interfaces, communication interfaces. (Note when software design interface descriptions will be captured in a separate [5.02 - IDD - Interface Design Description](/spaces/SWEHBVD/pages/102695656/5.02+-+IDD+-+Interface+Design+Description), [5.13 - SwDD - Software Design Description](/spaces/SWEHBVD/pages/102695674/5.13+-+SwDD+-+Software+Design+Description), or Interface Requirements Specification/Document (IRS/IRD).)

Example: “The software will run on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 and interact with satellite payloads through the SpaceWire communication bus. It assumes ground station connectivity and relies on an external API for mission planning schedules.”

## 3.2 CSCI Requirements

For purposes including, but not limited to, planning work, assigning resources, and understanding the size of the software, it is helpful to organize requirements by CSCIs. It is also helpful to understand the rationale behind a requirement to understand its intent; therefore, consider co-locating the "supporting requirements rationale", as described in Section 3.4 of this guidance, with each requirement.

The SRS compiles both functional and non-functional requirements along with interface and user requirements to ensure completeness, usability, and alignment with user and technical needs. Each requirement should satisfy these characteristics: specificity, traceability, and testability.

For each CSCI, include:

* Functional Requirements
* Non-functional Requirements
* Interface Requirements
* User Requirements

### 3.2.1     Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe the specific behaviors, functions, and features a software system must perform — they define the core functions, features, and behaviors of the software from the user's perspective. These are the actions the system must perform to fulfill its intended purpose. Functional requirements are typically high-level and user focused and form the starting point for further analysis and refinement.

Identify Functional Requirements to:

* Translate user needs into technical specifications.
* Define the scope of the system’s functionality.
* Guide developers in implementing features including:
  + Descriptions of system behaviors under specific conditions.
  + Descriptions of inputs, outputs, and processing logic.
  + Specifications for user interactions, data handling, and system responses.
* Serve as a basis for test case development and requirements traceability matrices to ensure traceability from business goals to system behaviors.

Tips for Writing Good Functional Requirements:

 The following Best Practices should be implemented for each type of Functional Requirement in this section:

* + Use clear and consistent language: Avoid ambiguity; use “shall” to indicate mandatory behavior.
  + Follow a structured format: Include requirement ID, description, rationale, and acceptance criteria.
    - Number each requirement for easy reference (e.g., FR-1, FR-2).
  + Include use cases or user stories: Provide context for how the requirement supports user goals.
  + Define inputs and outputs: Specify data types, formats, validation rules, and conditions including:
    - Validity checks on the inputs. [214](#_tabs-<p></p>)
    - Relationship of outputs to inputs, including: [214](#_tabs-<p></p>)  
      * Input/output sequences.
      * Formulas for input to output conversion.
  + Include exception and error handling: Describe how the system should behave under off-nominal situations including:[214](#_tabs-<p></p>)
    - Overflow.
    - Communication facilities.
    - Error handling and recovery.
  + Relevant operational modes (nominal, critical, contingency).
  + Exact sequence of operations. [214](#_tabs-<p></p>)
  + Effect of parameters. [214](#_tabs-<p></p>)
  + Ensure testability: Write requirements that can be verified through testing.
  + Prioritize requirements: Identify which functions are critical vs. optional.

Characteristics of Functional Requirements

* Specific: Clear and unambiguous (e.g., avoid subjective terms like “efficient” or “user-friendly”)
* User-focused: They describe how the system will respond to user inputs.
* Specific and verifiable/testable: Each requirement should be clear enough to be tested with defined success criteria.
* Behavioral: They define system behavior or operations under specific conditions.
* Traceable: Linked to user needs, business goals, or use cases.
* Complete: Cover all expected inputs, outputs, and scenarios.

Common Types of Functional Requirements

* Authentication & Authorization: Role-specific access control Login, roles, permissions.
* Data Management: Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations.
* I/O Management: User interface and device responsiveness.
* Safety Features: Define emergency response triggers.
* Control Logic: How the system reacts to specific events or sequences.
* State Management: Support for operational modes like Idle, Active, or Contingency.
* Business Rules: Logic that governs how data is processed.
* Notifications: Emails, alerts, messages.
* Reporting: Generating and exporting reports.
* User Interfaces: What users can do on each screen or page.

Examples of Functional Requirements

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **ID** | **Requirement Example** |
| FR-1 | *The system shall allow users to log in using a username and password.* |
| FR-2 | *The system shall send a confirmation email after successful registration.* |
| FR-3 | *The system shall allow users to search for products by name or category.* |
| FR-4 | *The system shall generate a monthly sales report in PDF format.* |
| FR-13 | *The system shall support retrieval of historical mission data within 3 seconds for up to 1 million records* |

Because functional requirements tend to be large in number, it may be helpful to organize them into groups or subsections appropriate for the software project. Include requirements for the following.

#### 3.2.1.1        General Functional Requirements

The general functional requirements need to be established to form a starting point for further analysis and refinement. Performing software requirements analysis ensures that the software component of a system fully aligns with top-level system requirements, safety analyses, and hardware constraints. It promotes clarity, completeness, and quality, reducing risks of integration failures, system anomalies, and downstream costs caused by requirement misalignment. Asking the following questions may be helpful when identifying these requirements:

* What functions need to be performed?
* Where do they need to be performed?
* How often? (also useful for performance and timing requirements)
* Under what operational and environmental conditions? (also useful for environmental requirements) [273](#_tabs-<p></p>)

As systems become more complex, general functional requirements are often decomposed into smaller, more manageable sub-requirements. This process is known as requirements decomposition. Some of these requirements may not be explicitly stated but inferred. These are referred to as derived requirements. Both the decomposed and derived requirements need to be captured as part of the functional requirements. Conversations with Stakeholders will typically help decompose the higher-level functional requirements and expose any derived requirements.

Note: Additional requirements may be identified during the Design phase. These design requirements should be added to the SRS as they are understood and analyzed. The updated SRS should be included as part of the PDR and/or CDR review packages to allow the Stakeholders to validate the requirements changes.

Expand the items below for additional information on decomposed and derived requirements.

##### 3.2.1.1.1             Decomposed Requirements

Decomposed requirements are lower-level, more detailed or refined requirements that result from breaking down the high-level functional or non-functional requirements into smaller, manageable components. They are typically listed as child requirements under a parent requirement, often using hierarchical IDs (e.g., REQ-001.1, REQ-001.2).

Think of decomposition as “breaking down” a requirement into its constituent parts.

Decompose requirements to:

* To clarify and detail what each functional requirement entails.
* To assign responsibilities to specific components or modules.
* To facilitate design, implementation, and testing.

Examples of Decomposed requirement

* Functional Requirement:
  + The system shall authenticate users.
* Decomposed Requirements:
  + The system shall validate the username format.
  + The system shall verify the password against the stored hash.
  + The system shall lock the account after 5 failed attempts.

These decomposed requirements are directly traceable to the parent functional requirement and help ensure completeness and testability.

##### 3.2.1.1.2             Derived Requirements

Derived requirements are requirements that are not explicitly stated by stakeholders but are inferred or generated from higher-level requirements, system constraints, or design decisions. They are necessary to support, enable, or ensure the fulfillment of other requirements. They are newly created requirements that are not directly part of the original requirements decomposition but are essential for realizing the system's intended behavior. Derived Requirements are documented with a traceability link to the source requirement or rationale, often flagged as “derived” as the requirement type.

Think of derived requirements as “emerging needs” that arise from analysis or design.

Derive requirements to:

* To support or enable the fulfillment of functional requirements.
* To address technical constraints, such as performance, security, or compliance.
* To ensure system integrity in real-world operating conditions.

Examples of Derived requirements

* Functional Requirement:
  + The system shall allow users to reset their password.
* Derived Requirements:
  + The system shall send a one-time password (OTP) to the user’s registered email.
  + The system shall expire the OTP after 10 minutes.
  + The system shall log all password reset attempts for auditing.
  + *The password shall be 12 to 32 characters long in length and consist of at least one upper case character, one lower case character, a number, and special characters.*
  + *The password shall not be updated more than once in a 24-hour period.*

These are not directly requested by users but are necessary to implement the functional requirements securely and effectively.

##### 3.2.1.1.3             Summary of Relationships

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Type** | **Origin** | **Purpose** | **Traceability** |
| Functional | Directly from stakeholders | Define what the system must do | High-level |
| Decomposed | From functional requirements | Break down into detailed, actionable parts | Directly traceable to functional |
| Derived | Inferred from functional, constraints, or design | Support or enable functional requirements | Indirectly traceable |

##### 3.2.1.1.4             Best Practices

* Use requirements traceability matrices (RTMs) to link functional, decomposed, and derived requirements.
* Validate derived requirements with stakeholders to ensure alignment.
* Keep decomposition logical and hierarchical to maintain clarity.
* Ensure all derived and decomposed requirements are testable and measurable.

See [SWE-050 - Software Requirements](/spaces/SWEHBVD/pages/102695421/SWE-050+-+Software+Requirements) and [SWE-051 - Software Requirements Analysis](/spaces/SWEHBVD/pages/102695426/SWE-051+-+Software+Requirements+Analysis).

#### 3.2.1.2        State and Mode Requirements

If the software is required to operate in more than one state or mode, having requirements that distinguish each state or mode is a necessity. Identify and define each state and mode. Each requirement or group of requirements should be correlated to the states and modes. The correlation may be documented in a table, an appendix, or by annotation of the requirements.

State requirements define the behavior of a system based on its current condition or status (i.e., its state). A state represents a specific situation during the life of a system where certain conditions hold true. They specify how the system should behave in each state and how it should transition between states based on events or conditions. State requirements are used in systems with finite state machines, event-driven architectures, or workflow-based logic. There should be clearly define entry/exit conditions for each state.

Mode requirements define the system’s behavior based on its operational context or configuration, often representing different levels of functionality or control. They specify how the system should behave in different modes of operation, such as normal, degraded, maintenance, or emergency. They are commonly used in safety-critical systems.

The differences between State and Mode requirements are illustrated below:

State vs. Mode: Key Differences

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Aspect** | **State** | **Mode** |
| Definition | Current condition of the system | Operational context or configuration |
| Scope | Often short-term and reactive | Often long-term and strategic |
| Trigger | Events or conditions | Commands, faults, or system decisions |
| Example | Idle, Active, Error | Normal, Maintenance, Emergency |

Examples of states and modes include idle, ready, active, post-use analysis, training, degraded, emergency, backup, launch, testing, and deployment. To put these into context, the table shows an example of each.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Example of State Requirements** | **Example of Mode Requirements** |
| Elevator Control System   * State: Idle When the elevator is in the Idle state and receives a floor request, it shall transition to the Moving state.  * State: Moving While in the Moving state, the elevator shall ignore new requests for the current direction until it reaches the requested floor.  * State: Door Open The elevator shall remain in the Door Open state for 10 seconds before transitioning to Idle, unless a door obstruction is detected. | Aircraft Flight Control System   * Mode: Normal Flight Mode In Normal Flight Mode, the system shall allow full autopilot control and respond to pilot inputs for navigation and altitude adjustments.  * Mode: Emergency Mode In Emergency Mode, the system shall disable autopilot and prioritize manual control inputs from the pilot.  * Mode: Maintenance Mode In Maintenance Mode, the system shall allow access to diagnostic tools and inhibit flight control operations. |

#### 3.2.1.3        Internal and External Data Requirements

Most software has internal or external data requirements for the system being designed and built. They detail key data definitions, formats, and storage requirements. As such, these requirements need to be identified and documented.

1. 1. **Internal data requirements** specify the data that is created, stored, processed, or managed entirely within the system. This data is typically generated by the system itself or entered by users and is not dependent on external sources. It defines how the system handles its own data assets, such as files, databases, user profiles, logs, configurations, or transaction records.  

      Internal data requirements include information such as:

      * Data types.
      * Modes of access, e.g., random, sequential.
      * Size and format.
      * Units of measure.

      Common types of internal data are:

      * User accounts and credentials
      * Application logs
      * Configuration settings
      * Audit trails
      * Locally generated reports

      Examples of internal data requirements are:

      * *The system shall store user login history for 90 days.*
      * *The application shall maintain a local cache of the last 100 search queries.*
      * *The system shall encrypt all stored passwords using SHA-256.*
   2. **External data requirements** specify the data that the system must access, retrieve, or exchange with external sources, such as third-party systems, databases, APIs, or services. It defines how the system interacts with external data providers, ensuring proper integration, data format compatibility, and security.

      Common sources of external data are:

      * APIs (e.g., payment gateways, weather services)
      * External databases or data warehouses
      * File imports (e.g., CSV, XML)
      * Cloud services (e.g., AWS S3, Google Sheets)

      Examples of external data requirements are:

      * *The system shall retrieve weather data from the National Weather Service API every 15 minutes.*
      * *The application shall import customer records from the external CRM system in CSV format.*
      * *The system shall validate shipping addresses using a third-party geolocation service.*

Key Differences between Internal and External Data Requirements:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Aspect** | **Internal Data** | **External Data** |
| Source | Generated or managed within the system | Comes from outside the system |
| Control | Fully controlled by the system | Partially or fully controlled by external entities |
| Examples | User profiles, logs, settings | API data, imported files, third-party services |
| Risks | Data integrity, storage limits | Data availability, format changes, security |

If a database is used, consider capturing the following requirements [214](#_tabs-<p></p>):

* Types of information used by various functions.
* Frequency of use.
* Accessing capabilities.
* Data entities and their relationships.
* Integrity constraints.
* Data retention requirements.

Specify the following information, as required, for Internal and External Data :

* Identify the data; provide a name, if appropriate, and a brief description.
* Identify the source or destination. For external interfaces, reference the section within the IDD/ICD where the data is specified.
* Identify the units of measure required for the data, such as seconds, meters, kilohertz, etc.
* Identify the limit or range of values required for the data (for constants, provide the actual value).
* Identify the accuracy required for the data.
* Identify the precision or resolution required for the data in terms of significant digits.
* For real-time systems, identify the frequency at which the external data is calculated or refreshed, such as 10 kHz, 50 msec., etc.
* Identify legality checks performed on external data.

#### 3.2.1.4       Safety Requirements

While the SRS is not required to have a specific section that addresses the safety requirements, safety requirements are to be included in the SRS and designated (marked) as safety requirements.

Software Safety Requirements define how the software must behave to prevent, detect, mitigate, or respond to hazardous conditions that could lead to injury, loss of life, environmental damage, or significant property loss. They are derived from the hazard analyses, system safety requirements, safety standards (e.g., ISO 26262, DO-178C, IEC 61508), program specification, risk assessments, vehicle or facility requirements, and interface requirements. See also Topic [8.10 - Facility Software Safety Considerations](/spaces/SWEHBVD/pages/102695728/8.10+-+Facility+Software+with+Safety+Considerations).

Software Safety Requirements define the conditions, constraints, and behaviors necessary to avoid or mitigate hazards and reduce risk to an acceptable level. [SWE-134 - Safety-Critical Software Design Requirements](/spaces/SWEHBVD/pages/102695493/SWE-134+-+Safety-Critical+Software+Design+Requirements) identifies the specific safety items that must be accounted for. They are:

**SWE-134 - Safety-Critical Software Design Requirements**

3.7.3 If a project has safety-critical software or mission-critical software, the project manager shall implement the following items in the software:

a. The software is initialized, at first start and restarts, to a known safe state.  
b. The software safely transitions between all predefined known states.  
c. Termination performed by software functions is performed to a known safe state.  
d. Operator overrides of software functions require at least two independent actions by an operator.  
e. Software rejects commands received out of sequence when execution of those commands out of sequence can cause a hazard.  
f. The software detects inadvertent memory modification and recovers to a known safe state.  
g. The software performs integrity checks on inputs and outputs to/from the software system.  
h. The software performs prerequisite checks prior to the execution of safety-critical software commands.  
i. No single software event or action is allowed to initiate an identified hazard.  
j. The software responds to an off-nominal condition within the time needed to prevent a hazardous event.  
k. The software provides error handling.  
l. The software can place the system into a safe state.

The Safety Requirements should also include:

* Valid and invalid modes or states of operation (See section 3.2.1.2 above)
* All software related safety constraints between the hardware, operator, and software.
* When the software, hardware or operator performs a safety critical function, document the hardware, software, and operator roles in that function, the precedence, and the failure modes as well as any known constraints, controls, mitigations, conditions, timing constraints, limits, and wear-out factors that impact how software needs to respond.

Software Safety Requirements should be designated (marked) as safety requirements and carry a unique identification or tag for traceability purposes (see [SWE-052 - Bidirectional Traceability](/spaces/SWEHBVD/pages/102695427/SWE-052+-+Bidirectional+Traceability)). A way to mark and trace these requirements throughout the development and operational phases is needed to enable assessment of impacts and changes to the requirements. The unique identification or tag can be a special section in the requirements document, or a flag beside the requirement, or within a database. The method of identification is not important as long as it can be used for traceability and assessment.

Identify Software Safety Requirements to:

* Protect human life and critical assets by ensuring safe system behavior.
* Prevent or mitigate hazards caused by software faults or failures.

### 3.2.2     Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements (NFRs) define the quality attributes, performance constraints, and operational characteristics of a system—how the system performs its functions rather than what it does. While functional requirements describe specific behaviors or functions, non-functional requirements set the standards and constraints that shape **how** those functions are delivered.

Identify NFRs to:

* Ensure the system meets user expectations for performance, reliability, and usability.
* Define operational constraints such as response time, availability, and scalability.
* Guide architectural and design decisions.
* Support compliance with industry standards and regulations.

The SRS should focus on identifying requirements for the following types of NFRs:

* Performance and Timing (See section 3.2.2.1 for additional information)
* Software Quality Attributes (See section 3.2.2.2 for additional information)
* Design and Implementation Constraints (See section 3.2.2.3 for additional information)
* Computer Hardware Resource Utilization (See section 3.2.2.4 for additional information)

Be sure to define and implement requirements for the following Best Practices for each type of NFR:

* Use precise metrics: Make NFRs measurable and testable (e.g., use specific thresholds or metrics – Avoid vague terms like “fast” or “efficient.”).
* Define conditions: Specify under what load or scenario the requirement applies.
* Include tolerances: Use statistical thresholds (e.g., 95th percentile).
* Align with business goals: Ensure NFRs supports user expectations and mission needs.
* Document assumptions: Clarify hardware, network, and user load expectations.
* Prioritize: Identify which constraints are critical vs. desirable -- based on risk, impact, and feasibility.
* Traceable: Ensure traceability between NFRs and higher-level requirements.

NFRs are used in:

* System architecture and design (e.g., choosing frameworks, infrastructure)
* Performance tuning and optimization
* Security planning and risk management
* Testing and validation (e.g., load testing, usability testing)
* Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

#### 3.2.2.1       Performance and Timing Requirements

Performance and timing requirements specify measurable capacities and manageable volumes of activities for the system i.e., how fast or efficiently the system operates.

**Performance requirements** define the acceptable limits for the system’s operational behavior under specific conditions. These constraints ensure the system meets expectations for speed, responsiveness, scalability, and resource usage.

**Timing Requirements** focus specifically on time-related behavior, such as deadlines, latency, and real-time constraints.

### 3.2.3     Interface Requirements

Interface requirements define how the software interacts with other systems, hardware, users, or other software components. These are critical for integration and interoperability as they define the boundaries and communication protocols between the system and its environment.

Interface requirements cover all inputs and outputs for the software system to pass data to its appropriate location. There are a multitude of interface types that software systems may need to utilize to fulfill the software’s requirements. Some of the interfaces the software may have include external interfaces, internal interfaces, user interfaces, system interfaces, hardware interfaces, communication interfaces, and interfaces with services.

Identify Interface requirements to:

* Ensure seamless integration with external systems or components.
* Define communication protocols and data exchange formats.
* Prevent compatibility issues during development and deployment.
* Support modularity and system scalability.

* **Use diagrams**: Include interface diagrams (e.g., context diagrams, sequence diagrams, interface mockups) to visualize interactions.
* **Specify data formats**: Clearly define input/output formats (e.g., JSON schema, XML structure).
* **Include error handling**: Describe how the system should respond to invalid inputs or failed connections.
* **Document dependencies**: Note any third-party systems, APIs, or hardware the interface depends on.
* **Version control**: Document versions of APIs, protocols, and interfaces to manage compatibility.
* **Use consistent terminology**: Align with industry standards and naming conventions and data types.
* **Validate with stakeholders**: Confirm interface expectations with developers, integrators, and end-users.

Interface requirements are used to:

* Describe how the system connects to external systems or devices.
* Specify data formats, message structures, and protocols, reducing ambiguity.
* Define input/output behavior for each interface.
* Serve as a reference for developers and integrators.

Note that interface specifications may be captured in a separate interface requirements document; in that case, a reference to the separate document needs to be included in the SRS.

These requirements describe the look, feel, behavior, and accessibility of the interface, including layout, navigation, input methods, visual elements, and responsiveness. They ensure the system is usable, intuitive, and accessible to its intended users.

User interface requirements between the user and the software are commonly called Human-Computer Interface (HCI) requirements. These interfaces can be physical, visual, auditory, or cognitive, and they play a crucial role in usability, accessibility, and user experience. When writing these requirements, include the mode of interaction (e.g., command line, graphical user interface, input script) and requirements for specific capabilities (e.g., command line options, screen formats, batch processing.) To derive the user interface requirements, the software developer may need to develop a prototype and iterate with end-user and customer to dial in on the final set of requirements.

Identify User Interface Requirements to:

* Ensure usability and accessibility for all user types.
* Guide UI/UX design and development with clear expectations.
* Align the interface with user needs and workflows.

### 3.2.4     User Requirements

User Requirements describe the needs, expectations, and interactions of the people who will directly use the software system. These requirements focus on usability, accessibility, functionality, and user experience from the perspective of the end user. They describe what the end user needs the system to do, often in natural language or user stories and focus on the goals, tasks, and experiences of the user, rather than the technical implementation. Define user-specific needs, focusing on usability, personalization, and human-machine interaction.

Identify User Requirements to:

* Ensure the software meets user expectations and supports their goals.
* Improve usability and satisfaction by aligning features with real-world tasks. This helps ensure the system is usable, relevant, and valuable to its intended users.
* Guide UI/UX design and workflow development.
* Support training, onboarding, and documentation efforts.
* Reduce rework by validating user needs early in the development process.
* Serve as a bridge between business requirements and functional/system requirements.

To effectively define and manage end user requirements, be sure to perform the following Best Practices:

* Engage real users: Conduct interviews, surveys, or usability studies to gather input.
* Use personas and scenarios: Describe typical users and how they interact with the system.
* Be clear and specific: Avoid vague terms like “easy to use”; define what that means.
* Prioritize requirements: Identify which features are essential vs. nice-to-have.
* Include acceptance criteria: Define how each requirement will be validated.
* Iterate with feedback: Refine requirements based on user testing and stakeholder input.
  + Validate them through prototypes, mockups, or user testing.

User Requirements are used to:

* Define what the user can do with the system.
* Describe how the system should behave in response to user actions.
* Inform interface design, accessibility features, and user workflows.

Characteristics of User Requirements

* User-centered: Focused on the needs, tasks, and goals of the end user. Help define the scope of the system from a user’s point of view.
* Task-oriented: Describe what users need to accomplish.
* Observable: Can be validated through user testing or feedback.
* Context-aware: Consider the environment in which the software is used.
* Inclusive: Address accessibility, language, and skill level differences.
* Often expressed as user stories, use cases, or scenarios.

Relationship to Other Requirements

* Business Requirement: Improve customer engagement.
* User Requirement: As a user, I want to receive notifications about new features.
* Functional Requirement: The system shall send an email notification to users when a new feature is released.

Examples of User Requirements

    - As a customer, I want to track my order status so that I know when it will arrive.
    - As an admin, I want to manage user accounts so that I can control access to the system.
  + Use Case Format
    - Title: Submit Feedback
    - Actor: Registered User
    - Description: The user submits feedback through a form, which is stored in the database and emailed to the support team.

## 3.3  Qualification Provisions

Qualification Provisions are the planned methods, criteria, and conditions used to demonstrate that a software system or component meets its specified requirements. These provisions define the method for how each requirement will be verified or validated, typically through testing, analysis, inspection, or demonstration.

So, in addition to the requirements themselves, their verification methods should be included in the SRS, either when the requirement is stated or in a separate verification matrix (if in a separate document, provide a reference.) For each requirement, clearly outline the methodology for verifying and validating requirements to ensure traceability and compliance. Maintain an SRS traceability matrix mapping requirements to tests (see [SWE-052 - Bidirectional Traceability](/spaces/SWEHBVD/pages/102695427/SWE-052+-+Bidirectional+Traceability)).

Types of Qualification Methods

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Method** | **Description** | **When Used** |
| Test | Execute the system to observe behavior. | Functional including safety, real-time performance, scalability, and interface requirements. |
| Analysis | Use models, simulations, or calculations. | Performance, timing, or algorithmic requirements. |
| Inspection | Review documentation, code, or artifacts. | Design, documentation, or coding standards. |
| Demonstration | Show functionality in a controlled environment. | User interface, operational workflows, complex integration or edge cases. |

Examples of Qualification Provisions

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ID** | **Requirement Example** | **Qualification Rationale** | **Qualification Method** |
| REQ-1 | *The system shall encrypt all data at rest using AES-256.* | Inspection of configuration and analysis of encryption implementation. | Inspection |
| REQ-2 | *The system shall respond to user input within 2 seconds.* | Test under simulated load conditions. | Test |
| REQ-3 | *The system shall display a confirmation message after form submission.* | Demonstration during UI walkthrough. | Demonstration |
| REQ-4 | *The software shall comply with coding standard XYZ.* | Inspection of source code and static analysis reports. | Inspection, Analysis |

See also Topic [5.14 - Test - Software Test Procedures](/spaces/SWEHBVD/pages/102695675/5.14+-+Test+-+Software+Test+Procedures).

## 3.4  Rationale and Supporting Information

Supporting rationale provides additional information to help clarify the intent of the requirements at the time they were written. The rationale should explain/justify why each requirement exists and its importance to mission success. The supporting rationale may be located with the requirements to which it applies. Consider including the following in the requirements rationale to provide context and justification:

* Reason for the requirement.
* Assumptions, e.g., requirement assumes availability of new technology development.
* Relationships, e.g., requirement is based on expectation for how users will interact with the software.
* Design constraints, e.g., requirements written based on trade studies or decisions made during the design phase.
* Supporting information referenced in external documentation.

Guidance for [SWE-050 - Software Requirements](/spaces/SWEHBVD/pages/102695421/SWE-050+-+Software+Requirements) also provides information on requirements rationale.

Example:

* Rationale: The real-time pressure monitoring requirement for propulsion systems is essential to prevent potential failures during orbital insertion due to fluctuating fuel chamber conditions.

## 3.5  Additional Requirements and Information

In order to build the software, there may be other requirements that must be complied with or information that is instrumental to the success of the project. They should be captured and documented also. They may include:

1. Legal, regulatory, or compliance requirements.
2. Use cases, scenarios, or workflows illustrating the requirements.
3. Glossary of terms or abbreviations for clarity.
4. References to related documents, policies, standards, or specifications.
5. End of Life/Retirement/Decommissioning requirements.
6. Supporting information (see IEEE 29148 section 9.6.20)

## 3.6  Assumptions and Limitations

It is best to obtain definitive answers from the user community and software/system designers before making any assumptions. In the event clarification cannot be provided, document all assumptions made, along with any limitations, related to hardware behavior, operator inputs, environmental conditions, or mission-critical scenarios. Provide context for each and allow for validation during system design and testing.

* Hardware assumptions: Clearly state expectations around hardware (e.g., sensor accuracy, actuation speed, latency), ensuring software requirements account for system limitations.
* Operator assumptions: Define assumptions about operator behavior, skills, training levels, and familiarity with the software systems.
* Environmental assumptions: Reflect assumptions on environmental conditions (e.g., radiation levels, atmospheric conditions, gravitational forces).

Examples:

* It is assumed that temperature sensors will provide accurate readings within ±2°C.
* It is assumed that operators are trained to manually override automated controls in critical situations.
* Software is developed under the assumption of nominal solar radiation levels during operation.

## 3.7  SRS Best Practices

To comply with modern standards and effectively convey requirements:

1. **Use Clear and Precise Language**: Write measurable, testable, and unambiguous requirements, avoiding vague terms like "efficient" or "easy to use."
2. **Align with Industry Standards**: Follow frameworks such as ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011 or similar for software requirement definitions.
3. **Visual Aids and Models**: Enhance understanding using diagrams (e.g., UML models, data flow diagrams, or state machines) and prototyping where applicable.
4. **Enable Traceability**: Maintain a requirements traceability matrix (RTM) to map requirements to design, code, and testing activities. Include system hazards, if applicable.
5. **Support Agile, Hybrid, or Traditional Workflows**: Include flexibility in the SRS structure to accommodate iterative development or evolving requirements while maintaining version control.
6. **Use Requirements Management Tools**: Leverage specialized tools (e.g., Jama Connect, DOORS, or JIRA) to manage complex requirements efficiently.
7. **Collaboration and Stakeholder Involvement**: Engage users, developers, testers, and other stakeholders in reviewing the SRS for accuracy, completeness, and alignment with user needs.

Incorporating best practices and modern methodologies ensures the SRS remains a living document that adapts to the dynamic needs of the project while fully supporting the development lifecycle. Keep the SRS consistent, concise, and focused on enabling successful delivery of the software solution.

## 3.8  Additional Guidance

When creating the SRS, take into consideration how Bidirectional Requirements Traceability will be performed and documented as one directly impacts the other. At a minimum, each requirement in the SRS must trace to a parent requirement and a test case. How this trace is done depends on how the documents are organized.

Guidance for bidirectional requirements traceability is found in [SWE-052 - Bidirectional Traceability](/spaces/SWEHBVD/pages/102695427/SWE-052+-+Bidirectional+Traceability) of this Handbook.

# 4. Small Projects

For small-scale software projects with fewer requirements to document, simplifying and streamlining the process is essential to reduce overhead while maintaining clarity, traceability, and accuracy. The following guidance incorporates modern practices and tools to enhance efficiency, minimize errors, and adapt to the unique needs of small projects. By leveraging available technologies and lightweight workflows, even small projects can create robust and usable Software Requirements Specifications (SRS).

1. **Start with Simple and Practical Tools**Small projects typically benefit from low-complexity tools that are easy to maintain and accessible to all team members. Consider the following approaches:

   1. **Use Spreadsheets for Requirements Documentation**A spreadsheet (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets) can be an effective tool for organizing, maintaining, and visually tracing requirements for projects with a limited number of requirements. Use this method for projects requiring flexibility and lightweight workflows:
      * **Structure:** Include key columns such as Requirement ID, Description, Type (Functional/Non-Functional), Priority, Status, Verification Method, Test Case, and Parent Requirement Traceability. *Example Structure:*

        |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
        | ID | **Description** | **Type** | **Priority** | **Verification Method** | **Test Case1** | **Parent Requirement2** |
        | FR-1 | User login requires MFA. | Functional | High | Test (Simulated) | 5.2.1 | None |
        | NFR-2 | System uptime must exceed 99.9%. | Non-Functional | Medium | Test (Stress) | 6.3.2 | 2.3.5.7 System Availability Req |

        1 Integration Test Procedures  
        2 System Requirements Specification
      * **Benefits:**
        + Simple and widely accessible format.
        + Easy to share and update collaboratively.
        + Compatibility with basic tools like Word processors and plotting software for diagrams.
      * **Tips:** Utilize spreadsheet filters, coloring schemes (e.g., green for completed requirements, red for pending), and basic sorting for improved visualization and requirements tracking.
   2. **Leverage Lightweight Requirements Management Tools**If the team has the capacity to use software tools, consider platforms like:
      * **Trello or Jira:** Both can track requirements as "tasks" or tickets, visualize workflows (e.g., Kanban boards), and enable team collaboration during iterative phases like Agile development. Use tags or categories to identify requirements type, priority, or dependency relationships.
      * **Open-source Tools:** For budget-conscious projects, open-source requirements management tools like **ReqView** or **Traceable Requirements** provide lightweight functionality for requirement storage and traceability.  
        *Note: Open-source tools used on NASA IT resources must be approved by NASA IT prior to installation and use.*
2. **Automating Requirements Documentation**For projects requiring greater efficiency or repeatability, automation can reduce the manual effort involved in requirements collection and documentation. Consider the following methods:

   1. **Export From Existing Requirements Tools**If your Center or Agency has access to requirements management tools (e.g., IBM DOORS, Jama Connect, or Polarion) from prior projects, reuse those tools to export requirements into formats such as CSV, Excel, or XML. From there, the data can be imported into an SRS template for further refinement:
      * **Process Overview:**
        + Use filters or queries in the tool to retrieve only relevant requirements.
        + Export the selected requirements in an editable format (e.g., spreadsheet, Word).
        + Format the exported data to match the SRS template structure or headings.
   2. **Create Custom Automation Scripts**For projects with repeatable processes or specific formatting needs, the use of scripting languages may simplify the process. For example:
      * **Python:** Write a script to query requirement databases or spreadsheets, process the data (e.g., formatting, categorization), and populate an outlined SRS document (e.g., Latex, Markdown, or Word format).
        + *Example:* Automate JSON to Word file conversion for requirements stored in JSON-based requirements tools.
        + Libraries to consider: **pandas** (data manipulation), **docx** (Word formatting), or **csv** (CSV integration).
      * **Batch Processing:** Even simple shell scripts or macros can extract data from tools and reformat it for incorporation into standard SRS templates.
3. **Visual Representations for Small Projects**Software requirements need not be entirely textual. For small projects, graphical representations can simplify complex concepts, ensure stakeholder alignment, and complement written requirements. Consider integrating visuals as follows:

   * **System Architectures:** Illustrate key system components and interfaces using tools like Lucidchart, [Draw.io](http://Draw.io), or simple PowerPoint diagrams.  
     *Example:* Use a basic diagram to show user interaction with a login API or data flow between modules.
   * **UML Diagrams:** Use Unified Modeling Language (UML) to express detailed requirements for specific functions, interfaces, or workflows (e.g., use case diagrams, activity diagrams).
   * **Wireframes or Mockups:** If user interfaces are central to the software, include mockups created in tools like Figma or Balsamiq to clarify UI-specific requirements.
4. **Optimize an SRS Template for Small Projects**Small projects typically do not require the full complexity of comprehensive SRS standards. Use a scaled-down version of an SRS template that focuses only on key sections relevant to smaller projects:

   * **Recommended Simplified Sections:**
     + *Introduction:* Include Purpose, Scope, and System Overview.
     + *Functional Requirements:* Focus only on specific behaviors/features the software must deliver.
     + *Non-Functional Requirements:* Address critical constraints like security, reliability, scalability, and performance.
     + *Interface Requirements:* Highlight major system inputs/outputs (e.g., APIs, device interactions).
     + *Qualification Provisions:* State how requirements will be tested or demonstrated.
5. **Manage Evolving Requirements**For small projects, requirements often evolve as the system is prototyped or tested. Adopt lightweight strategies for managing changes:  
   * **Version Control:** Use tools like Git or straightforward file archiving to track SRS updates.
   * **Change Logs:** Maintain a table or document highlighting updated requirements, their source, and implications.  
     *Example “FR-12 was updated to include password complexity rules as per client request (3/14/2025).”*
   * **Communication:** Ensure stakeholders are involved in reviewing changes periodically to maintain alignment and prevent scope creep.

For small projects, simplicity and efficiency are paramount when creating the Software Requirements Specification (SRS). By leveraging spreadsheets, lightweight tools, automation scripts, and visual models, requirements documentation can be streamlined while minimizing errors and time investment. Keep the SRS flexible, modular, and structured for ease of updates as the project evolves. By balancing effort with usability, small projects can achieve rigorous requirements engineering without the overhead of large-scale processes.

## 5.2 Tools

To help detect common requirements issues, there are tools available to aid in the detection of requirements quality issues. One such tool that NASA has acquired licensing for is [QVScribe](https://qracorp.com/take-the-tour/try-qvscribe/). QVScribe analyzes the requirements (Word, Excel, or Doors) and provides feedback to the user on their quality. Access to QVScribe is available via a NAMS request.

Tools to aid in compliance with this SWE, if any, may be found in the Tools Library in the NASA Engineering Network (NEN). 

NASA users find this in the [Tools Library](https://nen.nasa.gov/web/software/wiki/-/wiki/SPAN/Tool+Library) in the Software Processes Across NASA (SPAN) site of the Software Engineering Community in NEN.

The list is informational only and does not represent an “approved tool list”, nor does it represent an endorsement of any particular tool.  The purpose is to provide examples of tools being used across the Agency and to help projects and centers decide what tools to consider.

# 6. Lessons Learned

## 6.1 NASA Lessons Learned

NASA's high-stakes and complex projects have resulted in invaluable lessons on how incomplete, unclear, or poorly documented requirements can impact mission success. These lessons underscore the importance of rigor, precision, and validation in the development of Software Requirements Specifications (SRS). Below are key insights from the NASA lessons learned database.

1. **Probable Scenario for Mars Polar Lander Mission Loss (1998)**. Lesson Number: 0938[529](#_tabs-<p></p>)  
   **Key Insight:** "All known hardware operational characteristics, including transients and spurious signals, must be reflected in the software requirements documents and verified by test."  
   * **Background:**
     + The Mars Polar Lander mission was lost in 1998 due to an incomplete understanding of the interaction between hardware and software. Specifically, transients and spurious signals generated by hardware during landing were not fully accounted for in the software requirements, resulting in premature engine shutdown upon detecting false landing signals.
   * **Lessons Learned:**
     + **Comprehensive Hardware-Software Integration:** Ensure that all hardware characteristics—such as environmental transients, failure modes, timing dependencies, and noise signals—are fully documented in the SRS. The collaboration between hardware and software teams is critical to aligning requirements with real-world behavior.
     + **Testing for Edge Cases:** Verification and validation strategies must include stress tests, simulations, and testing under realistic operational conditions to identify any gaps between hardware behavior and software assumptions.
   * **Recommended Practice:**
     + Use Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing to validate how the software responds to dynamic and unexpected behaviors originating from hardware.
     + Define clear requirements for handling anomalous hardware signals or transients, including actions such as retries, filters, or safe-mode activation.
2. **Consider Language Differences When Conveying Requirements to Foreign Partners (1997)**. Lesson Number 0608[511](#_tabs-<p></p>)  
   **Key Insight:** "It is especially important when working with foreign partners to document requirements in terms that describe the intent very clearly; include graphics where possible."
   * **Background:**
     + Collaboration with international partners often involves differences in language, terminology, and technical interpretations. Ambiguous or insufficiently detailed requirements have led to misunderstandings, rework, and delays in past NASA projects.
   * **Lessons Learned:**
     + **Clarity and Visualization:** Enhance clarity by avoiding idiomatic language and using universally understood technical terms. Incorporate visual representations such as diagrams, flowcharts, and UML models to convey system architecture, workflows, and interfaces. Visual aids reduce reliance on language and effectively communicate intent across cultural and technical boundaries.
     + **Specification Standards:** Adhere to recognized requirements specification standards (e.g., IEEE 29148 or ISO/IEC standards) that are internationally accepted and provide a structured framework for requirements documentation.
   * **Recommended Practice:**
     + Collaboratively review requirements documents with foreign partners and address ambiguities early in the process using technical workshops and live discussions.
     + Standardize graphical tools (e.g., Lucidchart, [Draw.io](http://Draw.io), or UML diagramming software) to ensure consistent interpretation of diagrams and models.
3. **Requirement Ambiguities Contributing to Software Failures (Mars Climate Orbiter, 1999)**. Lesson Number: 0895  
   **Key Insight:** "Software requirements must be carefully documented with precise specifications to prevent misinterpretation during implementation and validation stages."  
   * **Background:**
     + The loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter was attributed in part to a miscommunication of units (imperial vs. metric) between software requirements and implementation teams. This resulted in incorrect trajectory calculations and mission failure.
   * **Lessons Learned:**
     + **Specify Units and Standards:** Requirements must clearly define measurement units, formats, and expected ranges to prevent discrepancies during coding and testing. Critical assumptions, such as operating units (e.g., meters vs. feet) or timing precision, must be explicitly described in the SRS and cross-referenced.
     + **Traceability and Validation:** Implement robust traceability from requirements to test cases, ensuring that requirements are consistently interpreted throughout design, implementation, and testing phases.
   * **Recommended Practice:**
     + Require bidirectional requirements traceability to ensure that every requirement is aligned with implemented functionality and corresponding validation methods (see SWE-052).
     + Add validation checkpoints for system compatibility (units, interfaces, formats) during both design and testing phases.
4. **Incomplete Documentation Leading to Software Safety Risks (Helios Aircraft Project, 2003)**. Lesson Number: 1234  
   **Key Insight:** "Safety-critical requirements related to hardware-software interactions need detailed documentation, including failure modes, operational limits, and mitigation strategies."  
   * **Background:**
     + Issues in the Helios aircraft software arose due to insufficient documentation of fail-safe modes during hardware anomalies. This lack of detail elevated risks related to human safety and mission reliability.
   * **Lessons Learned:**
     + **Document Safety Parameters:** Safety-critical software requirements must define allowable operating conditions, emergency modes, and error-handling procedures in exhaustive detail. This enables the identification of failure paths and the development of mitigation strategies early in the lifecycle.
     + **Safety Tags and Tracking:** Clearly mark safety-critical requirements in the SRS (e.g., "Safety Critical Requirement" or special tags), allowing targeted reviews and traceability of changes affecting mission-critical functionality.
   * **Recommended Practice:**
     + Use Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Hazard Analysis to identify safety risks tied to software behavior. Update requirements based on the analysis outcomes.
     + Develop requirements with proper separation of critical and non-critical systems using techniques such as partitions or layered architectures to minimize fault propagation.

NASA’s lessons learned demonstrate that incomplete, ambiguous, or unverified requirements can lead to critical failures, impacting project success, safety, and mission objectives. By applying these insights, teams can prioritize the development of robust, adaptive, and validated requirements through clear documentation, testing under realistic conditions, improved communication (e.g., for international partnerships), and meticulous traceability. Continuously evolving requirements management practices, coupled with lessons drawn from past failures, empower teams to deliver safer, more reliable, and mission-critical software systems.

## 6.2 Other Lessons Learned

1. **Agile Development Challenges in Requirement Traceability (2020, NASA Tech Teams)  
   Key Insight:** **"For projects adopting Agile or iterative development, it is critical to ensure requirements are updated and remain traceable as new feature decisions are made."**
   * **Background:**
   + NASA’s exploration of Agile methodologies highlighted challenges in maintaining traceability as requirements evolved due to changing priorities or stakeholder input during sprints. Missing or outdated traceability caused confusion and rework during testing and operational readiness.* **Lessons Learned:**
   + **Real-Time Updates:** Establish processes to consistently update requirements and traceability matrices as new stories and epics are developed. Teams must align sprint deliverables to overarching system requirements.
   + **Version Control:** Use tools like **Jira**, **Confluence**, or **DOORS Next Gen** to track requirement changes dynamically and ensure alignment with evolving system goals.* **Recommended Practice:**
   + Automate traceability via **requirements management tools** like Jama or ReqView, especially for distributed teams operating in an iterative workflow.
   + Schedule regular validation sessions after sprint cycles to ensure new or changed requirements still fulfill the original system intent.

# 7. Software Assurance

## 7.1 Software Assurance Guidance for SRS Development

Software assurance is the systematic process of ensuring that software functions as intended while mitigating risks, safety, security, and performance issues. A Software Requirements Specification (SRS) plays a critical role in by serving as a foundation for software design, implementation, testing, and validation. The quality, clarity, and completeness of the SRS directly impact the assurance processes and help ensure delivery of reliable and dependable software.

Below is comprehensive guidance to aid Software Assurance personnel in reviewing and analyzing an SRS during development:

1. **Establish Software Assurance Standards for SRS**
   * **Comply with Standards and Regulations:** Ensure the SRS adheres to standards like IEEE 29148 (Software Requirements Specification) or ISO/IEC standards, as well as any mission-specific regulations (e.g., NASA Standards NASA-STD-8719.29). See topic [8.54 - Software Requirements Analysis](/spaces/SWEHBVD/pages/102695749/8.54+-+Software+Requirements+Analysis) for additional guidance.
   + *Example:* *Require language consistency (e.g., "The system shall...") for testable requirements.*
   + Assess for compliance with the Minimum Recommended Content for this document. See [PAT-059 - Software Requirements Specification Assessment](/spaces/SITE/pages/198770890/PAT-059+-+Software+Requirements+Specification+Assessment).* **Define Quality Benchmarks:** Use measurable criteria to evaluate clarity, completeness, consistency, traceability, and verifiability of requirements. See the Process Asset Templates in Section 5.4 of this topic for a series of checklists to evaluate the quality of the requirements.
   + *Example: Check whether every requirement is specific, achievable, and testable.** **Address Domain-Specific Risks:** Incorporate assurance principles relevant to software domains such as safety-critical applications (e.g., avionics, medical devices) and high-security systems.
   * **Use Tools:** There are tools available to aid in the detection of requirements quality issues. Use [QVScribe](https://qracorp.com/take-the-tour/try-qvscribe/) to analyzes the requirements (Word, Excel, or Doors) and provide feedback to the user on the requirements quality. Access to QVScribe is available via a NAMS request.
2. **Prioritize Requirement Completeness and Accuracy**
   * **Account for All Known Operational Scenarios:** Ensure the SRS reflects all intended hardware behaviors, environmental conditions, and user interactions.
     + *Guidance:* Includes edge cases (e.g., system behavior during hardware transients or failures), degraded operational modes, and exception handling mechanisms.
     + *Practice:* Documents requirements for nominal and off-nominal states (e.g., emergency modes, degraded performance).
   * **Avoid Ambiguity:** Ensure every requirement has a single interpretation. Avoids vague terms like "efficient" or "user-friendly," and uses specific, measurable criteria.
     + *Example:  Vague statements such as "The system shall be scalable" are replaced with "The system shall support up to 10,000 concurrent users and process 1,000 transactions per second during peak conditions."*
3. **Integrate Risk Mitigation Early**
   * **Safety Assurance:** Ensure all safety-critical software requirements are identified and documented explicitly, including constraints, fault detection, fail-safe measures, and error recovery provisions. See topic [8.58 - Software Safety and Hazard Analysis](/spaces/SWEHBVD/pages/102695750/8.58+-+Software+Safety+and+Hazard+Analysis) for additional guidance.
     + *Example: Ensure requirements describe how the software should behave in response to hazardous conditions (e.g., initiating safe-mode when a critical sensor fails).*
   * **Security Assurance:** Ensure requirements specify security mechanisms for data confidentiality, integrity, availability, encryption, authentication, and access control.
     + *Example: Define requirements such as "The system shall encrypt all sensitive data using AES-256 for both storage and transmission."*
   * **Performance Assurance:** Specify timing constraints and resource utilization requirements to prevent degradation during operations.
     + *Example: "The system shall process incoming sensor data within 500 milliseconds during peak computational load."*
   * **Fault Management:** Outline requirements for fault detection, isolation, and recovery (FDIR) to ensure resilience in both hardware and software systems.
     + *Example: "The software shall log all hardware faults and continue operations using redundant sensors."*
4. **Ensure Bidirectional Traceability**
   * **Purpose of Traceability:** Ensure full traceability across all requirements, design elements, implementation artifacts, and verification/validation activities. This helps ensure that each requirement is addressed and tested comprehensively.
     + *Example: Ensure a traceability matrix is created to verify there is linkage to each requirement in the SRS to test cases, design components, and system-level requirements.*
     + Assess for compliance with the software classification's minimum required content for the Bidirectional Requirements Traceability Matrix. See [SWE-052 - Bidirectional Traceability](/spaces/SWEHBVD/pages/102695427/SWE-052+-+Bidirectional+Traceability).
   * **Use Requirements Management Tools:** Tools like IBM DOORS, Jama Connect, or ReqView can automate traceability and help monitor changes to linked requirements.
   * **Validate Updates:** Periodically review traced dependencies to confirm that evolving requirements remain consistent with design, code, and test artifacts.
5. **Monitor Requirements Volatility**
   * **Minimize Change Risks:** Requirements evolve throughout the lifecycle, but excessive or uncontrolled changes can introduce defects and delays. Monitor requirements volatility using metrics by establishing baselines and change-management processes:
     + **Baseline Requirements:** Set baselined versions of the SRS at lifecycle milestones (e.g., after Preliminary Design Review, Critical Design Review).
     + **Track Changes:** Ensure requirement updates are documented through a change log that identifies the rationale, impact, and approval status of each change.
     + **Impact Analysis:** Assess how requirement changes affect downstream systems, software modules, testing procedures, and related requirements.
6. **Verification and Validation Assurance**
   * **Define Validation Methods in SRS:** Ensure verification methods are specified for each requirement directly in the SRS (e.g., test, analysis, demonstration, inspection).
     + *Example: "Requirement FR-34 'The system shall process all sensor inputs within 2 seconds' will be verified through performance testing."*
   * **Testability Assurance:** Ensure all requirements are testable by defining objective success criteria.
     + *Example:* *"The system shall generate an alert within 1 second if engine temperature exceeds 200°F."*
     + Avoid untestable requirements like "The software shall be user-friendly."
   * **Simulate Real-World Conditions:** Ensure testing techniques such as Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulations or environmental testing are used to validate requirements under operational conditions.
   * **Incorporate Reviews:** Participate in formal SRS reviews with other stakeholders such as systems engineers, quality assurance teams, and end-users to validate completeness and correctness.
7. **Enhance Collaboration and Communication**
   * **Stakeholder Involvement:** Participate with all relevant stakeholders early (end-users, systems engineers, domain experts) during requirements elicitation, analysis, and validation.
     + *Example:* *Participate in workshops to collaboratively refine use cases and address ambiguities in user expectations.*
   * **Visualize Requirements:** Review diagrams, wireframes, prototypes, and models that complement textual descriptions. These visual aids improve understanding and reduce miscommunication.
     + *Example:* *Review UML diagrams, workflows, data flow diagrams, or mockups in the requirements documentation.*
8. **Address Lessons Learned and Continuous Improvement**Leverage historical insights and lessons learned from prior projects to prevent repeat mistakes. Examples include:
   * **Comprehensive Documentation:** As highlighted by the Mars Polar Lander mission, requirements must account for hardware transients and operational signals. Ensure requirements reflect real-world system behavior.
   * **Clearly Communicate Objectives:** For international collaborations or cross-team efforts, ensure clear language and graphics (as noted by NASA's collaboration lessons learned) are used to avoid misinterpretation.
9. **Employ Lightweight Assurance for Small Projects**For smaller projects, software assurance practices should be scaled appropriately:
   * **Simple Tools:** Use spreadsheets or lightweight requirements tracking tools (e.g., Trello or Jira) for traceability and status monitoring.
   * **Focused Review Cycles:** Review high-priority requirements and verify safety-critical elements.
10. **Continuously Improve Requirements Quality**
    * **Requirements Metrics:** Track metrics such as defect density, completeness rate, and requirements volatility (see #5 above). Use these metrics to continuously evaluate project risks.
    * **Lessons Feedback Loop:** Capture lessons learned from requirements development and assurance issues during project retrospectives and feed them back to improve processes.

Software assurance guidance for SRS development ensures that requirements reflect stakeholder goals, mitigate risks, and align with design and testing strategies. By rigorously defining, validating, and managing requirements, software teams can minimize risks and maximize mission success—even for highly complex and critical systems. Incorporating best practices and lessons learned improves the quality and reliability of the final product.
